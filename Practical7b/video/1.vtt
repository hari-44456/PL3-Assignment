00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.686
Here′s to the ones that we got

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.196
Chers to the wish you
were here but You are not

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.586
′Cause the drinks bring
back all the memories

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.676
Of everything we′ve been through

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.096
Toast to the ones here today

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.686
Toast to the ones that
we lost on the way

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.186
′Cause the drinks bring
back all the memories

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.076
And the memories bring back

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.186
Memories bring back you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.376
There′s a time that I remember
when I did not know no pain

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.986
When I believed in forever

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.586
And everything would
stay the same

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.286
Now my heart feel like December

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.896
When somebody say your name

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.686
′Cause I can′t reach
out to call you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.986
But I know I will one day

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.496
Everybody hurts sometimes‚
everybody hurts someday

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.486
Everything will be alright‚
go on raise a glass and say

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.386
Here′s to the ones that we got

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.386

were here but You are not

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.676

There′s a time that I remember
when I never felt so lost

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.386
When I felt that all the hatred
was too powerful to stop

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.896
Now my heart feel like an ember

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.686

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.376
