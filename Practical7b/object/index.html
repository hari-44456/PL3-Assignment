        <h2>Information about Digital Image Processing</h2>

      <p>
        <em>
          Digital image processing deals with manipulation of digital images
          through a digital computer. It is a subfield of signals and systems
          but focus particularly on images. DIP focuses on developing a computer
          system that is able to perform processing on an image. The input of
          that system is a digital image and the system process that image using
          efficient algorithms, and gives an image as an output. The most common
          example is Adobe Photoshop. It is one of the widely used application
          for processing digital images.

      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <h4>Signals and systems</h4>
      <p>
        Since DIP is a subfield of signals and systems , so it would be good if
        you already have some knowledge about signals and systems , but it is
        not necessary. But you must have some basic concepts of digital
        electronics.
      </p>
      <h4>Calculus and probability</h4>
      <p>
        Basic understanding of calculus , probability and differential equations
        is also required for better understanding.
      </p>
      <h4><b>You can refer following book for DIP</b></h4>

        <h2>Chemistry Department in wce:</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The chemistry department at present bears no specialized laboratory.
        Only laboratory facilities required for practical sessions of first year
        degree & diploma students are available. The laboratory is spacious & is
        capable to accommodate degree & diploma batches simultaneously. At a
        single session about 70 students can perform practical. This laboratory
        is thus general chemistry laboratory.
